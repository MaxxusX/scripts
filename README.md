## [Linoria](https://github.com/MaxxusX/RC-Scripts/raw/main/Linoria.rbxm)

* i guess lolcat already did thus but whatver im better than him
* Pretty much the same as LinoriaLib.
* Except for saving.
* I did fix some things though, like not being able to access transparency from a callback in the colorpicker.

## [Rayfield](https://github.com/MaxxusX/RC-Scripts/raw/main/Rayfield.rbxm)

* yeah its literally just rayfield.
* i changed wait()s into task.wait()s
